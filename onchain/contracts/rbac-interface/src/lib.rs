//! Shared RBAC types and client for cross-contract calls.
//!
//! Depend on this crate (rlib only) from other contracts. Deploy the `rbac`
//! contract crate separately — do not link `rbac` as a cdylib dependency.
//!
//! # Override-safety classification
//!
//! Every method on [`RbacContractInterface`] is tagged with one of two
//! classifications that future implementers **must** respect:
//!
//! * **`SECURITY-CRITICAL`** — the method encodes an access-control or ownership invariant. The
//!   default implementation provided by `rbac` **must not** be weakened, bypassed, or omitted by an
//!   alternative implementation. A subtle override here can silently degrade access control across
//!   every contract that depends on this interface.
//!
//! * **`SAFELY-CUSTOMIZABLE`** — the method is informational. The implementation may add metadata,
//!   paginate, reorder, or otherwise reshape the result, **provided** the result remains truthful
//!   with respect to the underlying state (i.e. it never reports roles that have not actually been
//!   granted, and never hides roles that have).
//!
//! Reviewers must consult `docs/rbac.md` for the full checklist used
//! when auditing a new implementer's overrides.
//!
//! # NatSpec-style tags
//!
//! The doc comments in this file use a small NatSpec-derived vocabulary
//! in addition to standard Rust doc sections:
//!
//! | Tag                       | Meaning                                                                 |
//! |---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `Customization safety:`   | Override-safety classification (`SECURITY-CRITICAL` / `SAFELY-CUSTOMIZABLE`). |
//! | `**Invariant:**`              | The invariant the method protects. Must hold after any implementation.  |
//! | `Risk if overridden:`     | Concrete ways an override can weaken the system.                        |
//!
//! Standard tags (`@notice`, `@dev`, `@param`, `@return`, `@panic`) are
//! preserved from the original contract documentation.
